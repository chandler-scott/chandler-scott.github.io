                                Dr. Hagelberg&apos;s research focuses on the computational treatment of
                                nanosystems, ranging from
                                molecules to periodic structures. Most of his present activities are
                                related to
                                nanoscience and
                                nanotechnology as the effort to characterize, assemble and manipulate

                                <h4>Quantum transport through low-dimensional structures.</h4>
                                <p>
                                        Materials with less than three dimensions are at the forefront
                                        of
                                        present condensed matter
                                        research as well as materials engineering. Low-dimensional units
                                        are of
                                        great importance as
                                        building blocks for tailoring an unlimited range of novel
                                        materials by
                                        implementing a bottom-up
                                        approach. Within this effort, research on quantum transport
                                        holds the
                                        key for several rapidly
                                        advancing disciplines, among them molecular electronics and
                                        nanospintronics, i.e. nanoscale
                                        electronics that operates with spin-polarized currents. Dr.
                                        Hagelberg&apos;s work in this field
                                        deals with graphene derivatives and transition metal
                                        dichalcogenides
                                        (TMDCs). Special emphasis
                                        is put on transport through magnetic nanostructures, such as
                                        graphene
                                        nanoribbons of the zigzag
                                        type (zGNRs), which are intrinsically magnetic, or of the
                                        armchair type
                                        (aGNRs), which may
                                        acquire magnetism by addition of magnetic impurities. These and
                                        related
                                        systems are examined in
                                        terms of their potential use as elements of nanospintronics.
                                        These
                                        include spin valves, spin
                                        transistors, and spin filters. In this context, Dr. Hagelberg
                                        explores
                                        the magnetoresistive and
                                        the spin filtering properties of various types of GNRs and
                                        TMDCs. His
                                        work involves
                                        computational modeling based on density functional theory (DFT)
                                        in
                                        conjunction with Green&apos;s

                                        Clusters are the &apos;missing link&apos; between molecular and
                                        condensed matter. In the context
                                        of nanoscience, they are of great relevance as building bricks
                                        for novel
                                        materials with tunable
                                        properties. Dr. Hagelberg analyzes metal and semiconductor
