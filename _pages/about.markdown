Welcome to my blog! I’m Chandler, a lecturer at East Tennessee State University, where I specialize in computer science. With a background in both teaching and research, I’ve had the opportunity to delve into various aspects of technology, from cybersecurity to networking and beyond.

I hold three IEEE publications, reflecting my commitment to advancing knowledge in the field. In addition to my academic work, I’ve actively participated in several cybersecurity competitions, which have sharpened my skills and provided practical insights into the evolving landscape of cyber threats and defenses.

This blog serves as a space for me to share my experiences, insights, and the latest developments in technology. Here, you’ll find posts on computer science, software tools, networking, cybersecurity, and more. I hope you find the content both informative and engaging!

Feel free to connect with me if you have any questions or want to discuss any of the topics covered here.
